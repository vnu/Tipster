Tipster
=======

+ Simple TipCalculator App in Swift. My First App in Swift. 
+ Some naive steps in detail for my own reference. 

##### Initial Setup
1. Create a new File -> Project -> Single Page Application
2. Set your simulator, deployment Target if needed etc., in General View
**Image 1**

##### Create your layouts
**Image2**
1. Open Main.storyboard
2. Start dragging your labels and text boxes, and align them and give some placeholder values 
3. UISegementControl used for tip percentage
4. UITextField for entering the value
5. The black bar is just a UIView with black background
6. Majority of the other fields are UILabels

##### Creating the outlets
1. Use the intersected circles on top right to open the editor
2. In your view editor, click the element. Press ctrl and drag to your controller
3. Add the name, format eg., tipLabel -> Add the type of element for easy identification
4. After outlets, start creating your actions the same way ctrl + drag and change options accordingly
